### Port of `libterminfo` from NetBSD **JPiec**

[`terminfo`][6] is a user-mode low-level library that exhibits terminal capabilities to libraries like [`curses`][7]. With those you may change terminal modes, move cursor, write to terminal in color and even define textual windows. Inclusion of `terminfo` will greatly improve Mimiker's user interface. We   'll present here relevant demos, when available.
