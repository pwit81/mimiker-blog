Good news everyone, reporting progress in Mimiker development!

### Preliminary virtual address space manager (vmem) implementation (by JPsz)

The kernel needs to keep track of allocated memory regions, both for
physical and virtual memory. Regions of pyhical memory are handled by
physmem subsystem of Mimiker (using classy buddy algorithm btw), while
virtual mem regions have been managed in an ad hoc way so far. This
will change in a near future: JPSz ported a variant of vmem subsystem
from NetBSD, thus providing abstractions of memory arenas, spans and
segments. An arena is a container of disjoint spans and each span
consists of disjoint segments. Here both spans and segments represent
contigous virtual memory addresses. Note that vmem doesn't allocate
physical memory, but only provides bookkeping services. It may e.g. be
useful in kmem (i.e. kernel memory allocator) implementation.

### Kernel can be parsed by Clang for static analysis purposes (by JPiec)
### Implement VFS name resolver - generalized version of `vfs_lookup` (by JUrb)
### Link cpio nodes with v-nodes correctly for initrd file system (by JSzcz)
### Load user program symbols automatically on GDB startup (by JMaz)
### GDB can access kernel memory even when CPU is in user mode (by JMaz)
### Kernel launch script can pass arguments to init process (by PJas)
### Port ksh (Korn Shell), cat & wc from NetBSD to Mimiker (by Cahir)
### Kernel bootstrap is performed in virtual addresses (by Cahir)
### Memory for pool and kmem allocator is provided lazily (by Cahir)
