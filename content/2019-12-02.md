Title: #4 bi-weekly progress report

Good news! Thanks to **JUrb** contributions we can create, delete and list
directories on tmpfs filesystem! We've got some contributions from students who
do not participate in the course officially :)

 * More tests for process groups (`setpgid`, `kill`, `killpg`). **AChud**
  
  Some simple functional tests for syscalls related to process
  identity were added to test suite. The more tests, the safer we
  are. Good!

 * Fix: don't deliver signals to zombie processes. **JMaz** 
 
   The `kill` syscall didn't check target process state when posting a
   signal, what caused kernel panic when the target was a zombie. This
   issue has been fixed.
   
 * Debugging: automatically swap user program symbols. **JMaz**

 As in case of other OSes, a session of Mimiker will most likely
 consists of multiple user process invocation.  Our debug
 infrastructure, however, was unable to load appriopriate debugging
 symbols from `ELF` file of currently running user-mode process,
 sticking to symbols from the first ELF file ever loaded. This defect
 has been repaired.

* Build kernel/user-space with Clang and run tests under CircleCI. **JPiec**

These two pull requests provide full support for building Mimiker with
Clang, both locally and as a Docker container in the cloud environment
CircleCI. We use CircleCI to run functional tests on pushed code
before merging it with master branch of Mimiker GitHub repository.

* vmem allocator: simplify code and add missing functions. **JPsz**


* tmpfs: implement `readdir`, `rmdir`, `rmdir` v-node operations. **JUrb**
 * implement `mkdir` & `rmdir` syscall. **JUrb**
 * Import `echo`, `mkdir`, `rmdir` & `pwd` commands from NetBSD. **Cahir**
 * Use high-resolution MIPS CPU timer for system clock. **Cahir**
 * Move kernel thread stacks, pool allocators, physical memory allocator to
   kernel virtual address space. **Cahir**
 * Introduce `kmem`: kernel wired virtual memory allocator. **Cahir**
 * Simplify kernel bootstrap: add list of physical memory segments. **Cahir**
