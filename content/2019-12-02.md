Good news! Thanks to **JUrb** contributions we can create, delete and list
directories on tmpfs filesystem! We've got some contributions from students who
do not participate in the course officially :)

 * More tests for process groups (`setpgid`, `kill`, `killpg`). **AChud**
 * Fix: don't deliver signals to zombie processes. **JMaz**
 * Debugging: automatically swap user program symbols. **JMaz**
 * Build kernel/user-space with Clang and run tests under CircleCI. **JPiec**
 * vmem allocator: simplify code and add missing functions. **JPsz**
 * tmpfs: implement `readdir`, `rmdir`, `rmdir` v-node operations. **JUrb**
 * implement `mkdir` & `rmdir` syscall. **JUrb**
 * Import `echo`, `mkdir`, `rmdir` & `pwd` commands from NetBSD. **Cahir**
 * Use high-resolution MIPS CPU timer for system clock. **Cahir**
 * Move kernel thread stacks, pool allocators, physical memory allocator to
   kernel virtual address space. **Cahir**
 * Introduce `kmem`: kernel wired virtual memory allocator. **Cahir**
 * Simplify kernel bootstrap: add list of physical memory segments. **Cahir**
