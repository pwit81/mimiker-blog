Good news! Thanks to **JUrb** contributions we can create, delete and list
directories on tmpfs filesystem! We've got some contributions from students who
do not participate in the course officially :)

 * More tests for process groups (`setpgid`, `kill`, `killpg`). **AChud**
  
  Some simple functional tests for syscalls related to process
  identity were added to test suite. The more tests, the safer we
  are. Good!

 * Fix: don't deliver signals to zombie processes. **JMaz** 
 
   The `kill` syscall didn't check target process state when posting a
   signal, what caused kernel panic when the target was a zombie. This
   issue has been fixed.
   
 * Debugging: automatically swap user program symbols. **JMaz**

 As in case of other OSes, a session of Mimiker will most likely
 consists of multiple user process invocation.  Our debug
 infrastructure, however, was unable to load appriopriate debugging
 symbols from `ELF` file of currently runing user-mode process. This
 defect has been repaired.

* Build kernel/user-space with Clang and run tests under CircleCI. **JPiec**
 * vmem allocator: simplify code and add missing functions. **JPsz**
 * tmpfs: implement `readdir`, `rmdir`, `rmdir` v-node operations. **JUrb**
 * implement `mkdir` & `rmdir` syscall. **JUrb**
 * Import `echo`, `mkdir`, `rmdir` & `pwd` commands from NetBSD. **Cahir**

Once directory and file-manipulating syscalls and vops are
implemented, it remains to provide user with corresponding
command-line tools. These taken from NetBSD simply work!

* Use high-resolution MIPS CPU timer for system clock. **Cahir**

Current hardware platform of Mimiker, the Malta board features legacy
`PIIX4` south bridge with `8254 Programmable Interrupt Timer`, which
upto now has been used as Mimiker's system clock. Some time ago, in
order to make kernel more hardware-agnostic and to provide it with
higher-resolution mesuring capabilities, **Cahir** decided to use a
timer built in the CPU and implemented it as one of Mimiker's
device. But at that time Qemu emulation of MIPS was flawed, and the
emulated timer failed to provide accurrate measures. This has been
recently fixed, and Cahir's code started to work as expected.

* Move kernel thread stacks, pool allocators, physical memory
   allocator to kernel virtual address space. **Cahir**

More and more kernel sybsystems are being moved to virtual
space. Great!



* Introduce `kmem`: kernel wired virtual memory allocator. **Cahir**
 * Simplify kernel bootstrap: add list of physical memory segments. **Cahir**
