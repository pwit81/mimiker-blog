Status: draft

With recent improvements we can finally test some real life scenarios with _Korn
Shell_! Finally we can read from and write to files in _tmpfs_ filesystem.
Moreover, we track current working directory for each process and enable limited
path lookup starting from the directory. Finally it feels like the shell is
usable, though we miss job control and terminal handling.
