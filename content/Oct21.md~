Good news everyone, we start posting weekly updates on Mimiker kernel
development. Read below what our team has coded recently!

##### `ioctl` syscall
As [NetBSD manpage](https://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?ioctl) says
> The ioctl() function manipulates the underlying device parameters of special files.  In particular, many operating characteristics of character special files (e.g. terminals) may be controlled with ioctl() requests.

And that's precisely the reason we need `ioctl`. Mimiker terminal handling capabilities are mediocre. We need colors, fonts and special characters support. https://github.com/cahirwpz/mimiker#568 

##### netbsd userland port

##### progress in signal handling
