Good news everyone. Mimiker weekly progress reports are back!


### pmap improvements in progress **PJ**
Do we really need to keep kernel page table for all pages in the virtual address space? No. In order to conserve precious RAM, we should boot up with very small page table and be able to grow it up upon request. This is the purpose of `void pmap_growkernel(vm_offset_t addr)` implemented by [#764][1]. The code *should* run on both our target platforms: MIPS (Malta) and AArch64 (RPi3, work in progress). 

### Further work on porting [KASAN][2] to Mimiker on AArch64. 
See also [this link][3](in Polish) 

### Simplify locking rules around `pgrp_t::pg_lock` **JPiec**
Improved handling of mutexes guarding structures of type `pgrp_t` (i.e. structures that maintain process groups) [#1030][4].

### Add interface to inverval timers (work in progress) **JPiec**
Implementation of two syscalls `setitimer()`, with which we can send SIGALRM to the calling process at regular intervals and  `getitimer()`, used to get the current timer state. This involed some fixess to callout semantics as well as adding the SIGALARM signal [#1023][6][#1026][5].

### A fix to `sys_exit` syscall **JPiec** [#1029][7]
### Some housekeeping **WP**, see  [#1033][8][#1031][9][#1032][10][#1008][11] 
### Cleaning interface for Kgmon profiler **WP**
The [Kgmon][13] kernel profiler interface has been trimmed down to suit Mimiker needs [#979][12].
