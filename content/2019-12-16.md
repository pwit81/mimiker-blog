**JPsz** started working on implementation of Kernel Address Sanitizer for
Mimiker.

Every OS kernel extensively employ dynamically allocated memory, and
is therefore vulnerable to its various abuses, some of which are:
using non-initialized memory, using a memory block after freeing it,
off-by-one errors during memory access, memory leaks. These errors can
be extremely hard to track down manually, thus any piece of software
helping in this task is warmly welcomed. The rough idea of address
sanitizers is to detect memory abuse at runtime by mimicking memory
operations (via code instrumentation) on an abstraction of true memory
state (shadow memory), and then checking consistency of that abstract
state when needed. Kernel Address Sanitizers (KASANs) have proved
useful in mature OSes (like Linux or Free/NetBSD), and we also hope
for benefits in the Mimiker project, which will not only be discovery
of actuall errors in the kernel code, but also prevenetion of
regression.


### Add remove v-node operation for tmpfs, implement unlink(2) syscall (by **JUrb**)
### Add support for creating file with open(2) syscall (by **JUrb**)
### Rewrite _AArch64_ kernel bootstrap code from assembly to C (by **PJas**)
### Map initial ramdisk into kernel virtual address space (by **Cahir**)
### Avoid TLB refill exception while working at Exception Level (by **Cahir**)
### Introduce changes required to build Mimiker for AArch64 (by **Cahir**)
